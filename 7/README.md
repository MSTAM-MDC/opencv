# Web Scraping and Image Processing

Requested 5 images to be collected from Library of Congress. Utilized BeautifulSoup for web scraping images. Downloaded images into directory images. Utilized computer vision (cv2) to process eligible images into grayscale and copied into the enhanced folder. Display the enhanced image when python file is ran.

Next Iteration: Display the side by side comparison of the original image collected from the library of congress and the enhanced image when python file is ran.
